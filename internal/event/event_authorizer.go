// Authorization Rules by Event Type:
//   - application_deleted: Only the application owner can delete the entire application
//   - member_removed: Members can remove themselves; owners can remove any member
//   - member_added: Any member can add others (authorization handled by invitation system)
//   - member_role_changed: Only owners can change member roles
//   - application_data_changed: Any member can update application data
//   - invite_revoked: Only owners can revoke invitations

// Returns ErrUnauthorized if:
//   - Submitter is nil
//   - Application is nil
//   - Submitter is not a member of the application
//   - Submitter lacks required role for the event type
//   - Event type is unknown
